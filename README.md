# HEAD COUNTING USING MEANSHIFT ALGORITHM
• It is a head counting approach for the uncluttered audience.
• Here I have used the the following concept for the algorithm designing-
1. Used Gausian MEAN Shift for trajectory, and frame diffferencing
2. Used Triplet network CNN for dynamic background subtraction.
3. Used deep learning for model training. Here, i have used Predective approach and wavelength quantization.
