# HEAD COUNTING USING MEANSHIFT ALGORITHM
• It is a head counting approach for the uncluttered audience. 
• Here I have used the the following concept for the algorithm designing-

Used Gaussian MEAN Shift for trajectory, and frame differencing
Used Triplet network CNN for dynamic background subtraction.
Used deep learning for model training. Here, i have used Predictive approach and wavelength quantization.
